Q: What are factpacks and how do I install them?
A: A factpack is a partial database of factoids that you can import into
   your configured infobot by running the script called "factpack.pl".

   # IMPORTANT: Run from the bots base directory!
   eg: ./scripts/factpack.pl /path/to/areacodes.fact

Q: Can I remove a fact pack I have installed?
A: Yes, but at the moment, you need to manually use SQL commands in your
   favorite SQL program. The "created_by" field in the factoids will be
   set to the filename of the fact pack you installed. For example, if
   you installed the "areacodes.fact" file, "created_by" would be set to
   "areacodes.fact". The SQL to remove the above example would be:

   sql> DELETE FROM factoids WHERE created_by = 'areacodes.fact';

Q: Where can I download some existing fact packs?
A: As of yet, the fact packs aren't available in SVN. You can try the
   original infobot web site at:

     http://www.infobot.org/factpacks/

   NOTE: The import script can't yet handle compressed files, so you must
   extract the factpacks in advance.

Q: How can I make my own fact packs?
A: The syntax is pretty basic. You just need a plain text file that has
   one key/value pair per line. Comment lines begin with a "#" character
   and are ignored, as are blank lines. Extra whitespace around key/value
   pairs should hopefully be stripped out as well. A few example lines from
   the areacodes.fact file:

     # Sample comment here
     area code 011 => the International Access Code
     area code 201 => Hackensack, Morristown and Newark, New Jersey
     area code 202 => Washington, District of Columbia


Q: The bot exits after I run 'factstats testing' or 'kernel' or anything
   that uses fork(). Is this a bug in the bot?

A: No, this is not a bug in the bot but rather Net::IRC.  A cheap hack is
   to edit /usr/lib/perl5/Net/IRC/Connection.pm, search for DESTROY, and
   comment out '$self->quit();'


Q: I notice that, in the bot logs, the bot attempts to close all current
   DCC CHAT connections whenever a forked process ends. Why is this?

A: Yet another bug in Net::IRC. Currently, DCC CHAT connections are not
   closed because there is an endless-loop bug when it is done.


Q: I executed 'scripts/setup_user.pl' but it said 'connection refused to
   localhost'

A: Looks like a bug in the installation of mysqld. You need to reload or
   restart the daemon.
	reload => 'mysqladmin -u root -p reload'
	restart => '/etc/init.d/mysql stop; /etc/init.d/mysql start'

Q: How do I get my bot to automatically ask for OP's from chanserv?

A: By default, the "chanServCheck" option is off in _default. You can
   set it on a per channel basis or as default. For example, the following
   commands will enable asking for OP by default, except on #notmychannel

	chanset _default chanServCheck 1
	chanset #notmychannel chanServCheck 0

# vim:ts=4:sw=4:expandtab:tw=80
