# Revised: 19991109.
#  Author: xk
###

main: I learn mainly by observing declarative statements such as "x is at http://www.xxx.com", and then reply when people ask things like "where can i find x?"

author: oznoid (mailto:lenzo@ri.cmu.edu) is my original author.

corrections: If I come back with "...but x is at http://xx.xx.xx" or something like that, and you want to change the entry, use "no, x is at http://sdfsdfsdf".  The "No," tells me to supercede the existing value.
corrections: you can append stuff to a factoid with "also". "x is also at ..."

action: This is used to override the usual response. "x is <REPLY> does the hokey-pokey". When asked about x, the bot does this "* infobot does the hokey-pokey"

reply: There is a special tag, <reply>, that is used to override the usual response.  Usually, a response is "X is Y", but it can be made "Y" by making the entry "X is <reply> Y".  
reply: This is a good way to close junk entries; use "X is <reply>" with nothing after it.

alternation: The || symbol in an entry causes an infobot to choose one of the replies at random. "X is Y|Z" will produce "X is Y" or "X is Z" randomly.

# now the commands...
lobotomy: i can be given a lobotomy ([o] is required) if people start to abuse me.  to bring me back to life, give me an unlobotomy

unlobotomy: which is not possible in real life, an unlobotomy will bring me back to life in the case of a lobotomy.

addressing: it is a good idea if i stay in REQUIRE mode then i won't yell out random crap if i listen in too hard.  currently there is no way to turn this of on-the-fly.
