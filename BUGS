Known bugs that should be dealt with soon as possible:

	* Older CMD: foo's cannot be used or removed. Must be removed manually from the database with SQL
	* !+topic list gives and incorrect error Failed. "You (#botpark) are not in #botpark, hey?"
	* Bot tries to ask chanserv for OP's on any channel. Should be a chanset setting on a per channel basis
	* News is currently stored in a file rather than the SQL table created for it
	* bot doesnt seem to keep track of stat counters for "heh :) ...etc". Might be settings though and not a bug
	* !help has size issues. Add's extra lines with only 1 or 2 help commands instead of one maximum size IRC msg
	* FIXME: !WARN! ircCheck: we have a NULL chan in hash channels? removing!
	* Bot can be flooded offline with a crash if !+factstats help and /msg nick factstats help, are used at the same time
