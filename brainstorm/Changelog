This is where your reply should go. See what I mean? Anyways, just carry
on ideas in here unless were both on irc. More of a memo service this is
i guess. As we reference files, just place them in the subdir i made called
"incoming" for now, unless you have a collection of related files, then
make a dir accordingly I guess. Then just make reference to the file in
here like so:

* incoming/readme.txt -- Description

Ya its just a changelog, but at least its quick and simple. Ne need for date
and time stamps I guess :)

Well, lets just start by tossing ideas and files back and forth here.
I do prefer svn over something like say email. Usually just easier to
edit a quick txt file. Lets try keep it kind of seperate though so
we can more easily distinguish between walls of text :)

I guess just put new replies at the top and seperate between posts with
some kind of line delimiter.
