	- Debian.pl's infoPackages() now checks for incoming
	  automatically and shows the new file.

	- Also added pgSQL support.  Will not work out-of-the-box.
	- Updated README.
	- Fixed up 'modules.pl' a bit so if anything fails, it exits
	  gracefully.  Module reloading should work better now.
	- DCC CHAT commands now must have '.' prepended otherwise all text
	  will me broadcasted to the dcc chat arena.
	- Removed command 'part'.  Use 'kick' instead :)
	- 'random|cookie' now takes argument to narrow down randomness.
	- Merged 90% of MbM's@OPN modifications. Thanks.

		- renamed Modules.pl to CommandStubs.pl
	- Added command 'cycle'.
	- hardguy/max noted that insult was borked.  It wasn't converted

	- Added to-expire-time on 'ignorelist'
	- Forgot to clear %ignoreList on loading the list.
	- moved 'ignorelist' from DCC-only to public/private msg.

v1.0.0pre11 (20000601):
	- we call &ircloop() if we want to reconnect. Any harm to perl?
	- Wingate fixed yet again. maximum time for response is 6secs in
	  order to cache maximum number of hosts.
	- Added ban() for Wingate.
	- Forgot about virtual host support when changed over to Net::IRC

	- Added limit to how many random things we can have in a factoid
	  to prevent endless loops from occurring.
	- All debian stuff now fully forks -- good.
	- Failure on &loadMyModule() now deletes $forked{$label}.

	- ...

v1.0.0pre10 (20000523):
	- Fixed minor problems in Debian.pl, I hope.
	  => DebianDownload now calls generateIndex() if a download is
		successful.
	  => More clean ups.
	  => generateIncoming() forgot about checking stale of idxfile.
	- Modules in Modules/* now dynamically loaded. Using about ~200k
	  less ram now.
	- Added support of user modes with param{ircUMODE}. Requested by
	  Flugh.
	- hookMsg modified, we don't check ignore list if we're not
	  addressed or minvollength is defined. flooding is now
	  configurable by repeated message and total message, expire time
	  and count, like eggdrop.

	- Included patches to modify stock-brokeness of perl modules.
	  'cd /usr/lib/perl5; cat *.patch| patch -p0'
	- Setup option whether to cache user online stats. Disabling will,
	  for sure, won't bloat the bot by 2-4megs (but why that much?).

v1.0.0pre9 (20000512):
	- Typo for outsider checking. Noticed when #debian flooder came
	  back yet again :)
	- seenCycle was in minutes instead of days. fixed.
	- Added User Information Services module. requested by Flugh.
		=> 'uinfo <nick>'
		=> 'uinfo set <type> <what>'
		=> 'uinfo unset <type>'
	- Added &IsNickInAnyChan($nick);
	- Added &DCCBroadcast($txt) to broadcast messages to all members
	  of DCC CHAT.

	  flooding instead of 'ignore' through DCC CHAT.
	  => remove time for 'ignore' through DCC CHAT?

	- added 'reload', to reload Core and Extras Modules. Does it
	  reload only if the file has changed?

	  downloads. regetting will be added soon afterwards.
	- minor fix for Debian.pl where a package exists but an
	  incomplete Packages file may not have info on that package.
	- Modified on-the-fly ignore to be temporary. temporary ignore
	  requested by jCommons.
	- added 'factstats requester'.
	- preliminary use of scheduler for &checkPing() in &on_init().
		no event hook on 'pong' :(((
	- Timers now use Net::IRC's scheduler, woohoo. Nice change over.
	  Moved ProcessExtras.pl to Schedulers.pl.
	- Added 'factstats deadredir'.
	- Don't prevent auto-reconnecting due to disconnection.
	- Forgot initialization before any new IRC connection.
	- Added scheduler for checking IRC connection.
	- Fixed problem in Freshmeat module, if forked to download, would
	  not continue with query. => now it does, nice hack.
	- Debian module should generate incoming index if does not exist.
	- Chatting can be done through DCC CHAT.
	- ...

v1.0.0pre7 (20000426):
	- INSTALL and README updated.
	- auto-request for ops after joining all channels instead of after
	  each channel join.
	- If factoid is requested by someone, show literally (no
	  evaluation) if owner of factoid matches aswell as if requested
	  privately(good idea?)
	- on_notice fixed and debugging info removed.
	- Added reconnect on HUP if we're not connected. I hope that it is
	  set to 0 otherwise this solution is dead.
	- ';' added as address char.
	- maths bug found by NoNix4.
		eg: 6000.0/9.000 - 6.000/9.000 - 666.00001
	- nickometer bug (pi not defined) found by ddent. 'strict' cleanup.
	- Preliminary CLI code included. Good for local use.
	- typo in Topic.pl, found by jCommons. Fix for NULL topic.
	- minor Debian.pl update to deal with 'missing files' on download.
	- multi-shmwrite support added. looks like it doesn't "refresh"
	  the value properly if written many times.
	- &verifyUser() only used if addressed.
	- Applied 'use strict' to all code. Also used 'use vars qw()'.
	- Added 'backlog #' to DCC CHAT. requested by jCommons.
	- ctcp version reply wrong; FIXED. found by fooz.

v1.0.0pre6 (20000407):
	- README updated.
	- Added retry on failure to reconnect through on_disconnect();
	  REMOVED -- this spun an endless loop.
	- Found why Googling didn't work. See README for fix.
	- Forgot about channel casing bugs (on_{join|part}) after
	  changeover to Net::IRC.
	- Changed addForked() to cycle through fork list and delete stale
	  forks in case a forked child dies unexpectedly.
	- Renamed allowOutsiders to disallowOutsiders just in case if the
	  option is removed from the configuration.

v1.0.0pre5 (20000331):
	- setup_users.pl. DBI*() => sql*().
	- 'topic add BLAH' on empty topic would bork. Why didn't I pick
	  this up before?
	- Somehow I removed (or it wasn't there) 'my @results' from
	  searchTable();
	- nickometer now uses loadPerlModule()... another 500 kB saved :)
	- repeat flood detection prevention added.
	- Added el-cheapo hash key counter... possible leak detector.
	- Added 'factstats lame' for short and most probably stupid
	  factoids.
	- Weather module removed
	- Renamed 'join' to 'joinchan' to due warning//conflict raised
	  with perl 5.005 (on potato not slink).

	- 'infobot' now first loads core.pl and logger.pl.
	- timerExpire() fixed.
	- Added unique maintainer count to 'dstats'.
	- Added demand-on-load of external perl modules. Now we need
	  dynamic(on demand) loading of 'Modules/*.pl' modules ;)

v1.0.0pre3 (20000319):
	- Fixed Freshmeat.pl not to show duplicate packages found by
	  'name' and 'oneliner' search. Made showPackage() function.
	- Debian modules now does multi distro. (woody's non-us appears to
	  be different structure so does not work :(, very crude hack...
	  may not even work).
	- Added subfactoid randomising. eg: '(one|two|three)'.
	- 'dauthor' now works!
	- karma fixed... used the wrong var name.
	- Fixed doubling of text when message from 'nick' is ignored.
	- Added 'redir' to designate one factoid as master and duplicates
	  as redirectors//slaves.

	- Seen info now cached and flushed at intervals or upon exiting.
	- Added 'EXAMPLES' file to doc/.
	- Removed ancient '&channel()'.
	- Bug fixes after offshore installation of bot.

	- Debian distro stats added. I'm competing with larne and his mods
	  to dpkg@OPN#debian :) so far so good.
	- Forgot to close shm upon exit, heh :) However this does not
	  prevent leakage when the bot crashes.
	- Parameter 'forking' now works, courtesy of generic &Forker()
	  function, woohoo! Now we use &Forker() for _everything_.
	  I had this in the todo list, removed it and decided to implement
	  it once and for all.
	- More bug fixes when moved changes to 'apt'. Several "bug
	  reports" sent from #debian, thanks!
	- Moved infobot communications _after_ ignore checking code.
	- babelfish changed format? disabled for the time being.
	- ...

	- Grep nick from list of nicks in IsNickInChan(). Bug found by
	  Mercury.
	- Time taken and final xfer rate displayed in FTP.
	- Fixed bug where 'or' is eval'd in Math.pl. Return '' if eval()
	  is not done. Bug found by dent.

	- Removed IrcHooks.pl and CTCP.pl.
	- Moved hooks stuff to IrcHooks.pl.
	- Moved IrcExtras.pl to Irc.pl.
	- Removed ansi_control option. colors can be stripped within
	  &status() anyway, like for logging.
	- Added DCC CHAT and DCC SEND support base.

	- Unified tell code in Process.pl.
	- Moved variable fix and addresing code to IrcHooks.pl
	- Moved tell code from Question.pl to UserExtra.pl.
	- Found that % and \ were double backslashed; added it to invalid
	  factoids. May have been caused by whoever unbacked up 'apt',
	  cerb? :) May want to add a function to automatically fix badly
	  formed factoids.
	- Added 'factstats profanity', with &hasProfanity($str).
	- Added functions for shared memory usage.
	  Uses: prevent exploitation of forked processes.
	- Added 'factstats unrequested'.
	- stale variables (vhost_name) forgotten in changeover.
	- UPDATE:
	- Fixed major leak with cycling of flood messages, typo :)

v0.99pre11 (20000123):
	- Fixes here and there...

	  to contents file search.
	- Fixed typo related to log cycling.
	- Added netsplit detection code.
	- Started DCC support... very early stages.
	- Replaced several 'foreach' statements with 'if' for efficiency.
	  About 5 instances of code...

	- 'factstats locked' returns list instead of only count.
	- &DoModes() bug found by larne.
	- Used '$nick' instead of 'lc $nick' for $channels.

	- Moved parts of User.pl to UserExtra.pl.
	- Moved myRoutines.pl to UserExtra.pl.

	- Removed fortran math due to poor code style.
	- Moved parts of Question.pl to UserExtra.pl.

v0.99pre9 (20000115):
	- Added messagecount column for 'seen'. Not used as yet. It
	  appears to be pointless, yes?
	- Cleaned up DBI.pl: made use of $dbh->quote(); added
	  &DBIRawReturn(), &DBIInsert(), &DBIUpdate().
	- Forgot to clear $tell_obj after successful 'tell'. Founded by
	  solomon.
	- Extra modules loaded only if enabled in config, may save some
	  ram.
	- Math.pl cleaned up.
	- Added DumpVars.pl, now we know where things are being leaked.
		- Removed duplicate 'use IO::Socket'.
	- Typo in "disabled" locking code which didn't work :) Founded by
	  washort.

v0.99pre8 (20000110):
	- Bailout if critical configuration variables are not found.
	- Dict.pl works well now.
	- Topic.pl now uses %topic or @topic. Added 'topic info' which

	- Added &DBIRaw().
	- Addressing required on all commands.
	- Added &fixFileList() to simplify files with common directories.
		- RevHippie stumped me with the best method to write this,
		  heh. Why do I always try to do things in 1 loop instead
		  of 2 loops?

v0.99pre7 (19991230):
	- Renamed some setup/DBI calls.
	- Simplified nickserv/chanserv code. chanserv opping may break
	  though. Experimentation?
	- Fixed broken stuff scripts/* due to src/* modification.
	- Added table locking support. BROKEN.
	- param{'ident'} deprecated.

	  factoids) to factoids.*
	- Added ircII.servers support.

	  Removed (rather used raw) use of fixmysqlbug for DBISetRow()
	- Added 'seen random'; fixed randKey to work with 'seen'.

	- Applied patch from RevHippie.
		- Removed auto continuation code.
		- Fixed learn =~ /HUNGRY/;

	  Files.pl.
	- Removed Internic.pl and Traceroute.pl.

	- Freshmeat.pl, forgot about &main::, again.
	- logType, broken date value.
	- Fixed broken 'tell blah about what', readded $answer var.
	- minLengthBeforePrivate superseeds preferReply.
	- Forgot to use 'my' on three instances of $sth.

v0.99pre4 (19991219):
	- Added 'dupe' for factstats.
	- Added illegal character detection in Statement.pl.
	- Unified output (and duplication) of factstats (and other) code
	  to use one function, &formListReply(). Reduced code by at least
	  2k :)))
	- Minor modifications to &DBIGetCol();
	- Move +s flag to 'set search' in infobot.config.
	- Altered talkMethod to allow 'private' or 'default'. Made no
	  sense to have it on public-only, heh.
	- friendlyBots will be kept to be compatible with other stock
	  infobots but soon enough multiple mysql database support will be
	  added. Will be quite nice once done.
	- Added maxListReplyCount and maxListReplyLen. Read infobot.config
	  for details.
	- Replaced $refresh with freshmeatRefreshInterval to config.
	- Changed learn setting from ALWAYS to HUNGRY.
	- Reorganised Extras.pl, we shouldn't bail out if the command
	  can be disabled as the person who runs the bot should have
	  brains.
	- Moved some Process.pl stuff to myRoutines.pl.
	- ---
	- &searchBy*() allows ^ and $, like in regex (basically sar'd).
	  removed $notexact variable.
	- Fixed 'no,blah is blah' bug.
	- Changed 'is also' char to ';;'.
	- Added &IsInvalid(); to unify Statement (when creating) and
	  factstats/broken (when checking/verifying). Works like a charm
	  :)))
	- Removed sane stuff; added infobot.ignore. I hope lenzo's
	  ignoreList code works.
	- Fixed setupmysql.pl
	- Moved repeatIgnoreInterval to minRepeat*Reply where * is Private
	  or Public.
	- Now preferReply works. Wasn't hard as it first looked.
	- Added global '+' flag support.
	- Fixed logging: added logType param; if logType =~ /DAILY/, new
	  log is created daily. Date is time-of-day, aswell.
	- added &fixMySQLBug() => adds backslash to special chars.

v0.99pre3 (19991216):
	- Fix connection bug where if host does not resolve, it appears
	  that it's connection refused. Now non-resolving hosts are
	  detected earlier. Found by some *.it (or .es??) guy.
	- Added 'sync in #s' when the bot has joined a channel... just
	  like in BitchX.
	- Added txt2mysql.pl.
	- Removed instances of '^\s*' to '^' since $message can be
	  manipulated in Process.pl.
	- Fixed Statement.pl so that it doesn't catch queries... it's a
	  stupid idea any way.
	- Removed 'confused' in favour of 'dunno'.
	- Funny hack in performReply(). Stupid but it works.
	- Added 'host' column in seen table.
	- Made use of &gettimeofday() for freshmeat and search function.

v0.99pre2 (19991213):
	- Made use of new database (directory) not to interfere with other
	  crucial dbs.
	- Re-added &getKeys(), mysql's RLIKE wouldn't like "'" in the
	  statement. If several of similar queries are required, better
	  off using &getKeys().
	- Added two more conversion scripts.

v0.99pre1 (19991211): personal release. MAJOR CHANGES.
	- create a script to add the blootbot user to the mysql server and
	  prepare tables for use with the bot.
	- butchered Question.pl, Reply.pl, Statement.pl and Reply.pl.
	- main factoid db ported over; barely tested.
	- seen ported over; appears to work.
	- karma ported over; not tested at all.
	- freshmeat ported over; fix brokeness.
	- search (listvals and listkeys) ported over.
	- rootwarn ported over.

	- Use quotemeta in DBI.pl on special chars, especially ' :)
	- Added factstats 'broken' function.
	- Made use of multiple connections to avoid clashing... does
	  clashing only occur when there's an INSERT/UPDATE or SELECT or
	  both?
	- Changed $factoid to $faqtoid... good idea? how about $lhs?
	- Changed getKeys to countKeys to take advantage of mysql.
	- Added randKey to get random primkey,key from table.
	- Removed process() when msgType == 'public action'. Why would we
	  want to care about actions anyway?
	- Fix public action; Added private action to &status().
	- Added &ERROR();
	- Made message and who flooding independent in IrcHooks.pl. Now we
	  use %flood... should be expanded to use %ignoreList;

	NOTES...
	- DBI.pl has more functions than what DBMExtra.pl had in order to
	  implement a table-like hash list.
	- &DBISet() always verifies if an entry already exists and does an
	  UPDATE instead of an INSERT... flaw in mysql or my code???
	- &DBISet() can only set one (in UPDATE, two in INSERT), variable
	  at a time. Does this impose a performance hit? like on seen.
	- ...

	TODO...
	- infobot.cgi not ported over.
	- weather not ported over.
	- add alarm call between while in Dict.pl.

*************************************************
************* CHANGE OVER TO MySQL **************
*************************************************

v0.18.2 (199912??): dropped.
	- Fix for Weather.pl.
	- Fix for Dict.pl.
	- ...

v0.18.1 (19991130): last public release before database change over.
	- Modified &IsNickInChan() so that a foreach is done case
	  insensitively against nick to prevent misses.
	- Added server "jump" support, requested by larne.
	- Added seenMaxDays, maximum number of days to keep seen info on
	  someone, otherwise delete it.
	- Forgot to use $main:: in Freshmeat.pl and Weather.pl; fixed.
	- Changed userList format to $userList{$user}{$flag}{$what} = 1;
	  Converted all code to use this userList format.
	- Changed version string to include OSname.
	- Replaced $locWho with $who or $origWho.
	- Removed hidden whitespaces and tabs at and of statments.

v0.18.0 (19991128):
	- Post release typo fixes here and there.
	- Changed lc() to tr/A-Z/a-z/ where suitable.
	- Redid join command in Process.pl.
	- Cleaned up regex (mainly .* => \S+).
	- Found $ischan to be broken; fixed.
	- Changed Slashdot3.pl to have "joining" code like in DBMExtra.pl.
	- Made use of &nick() and &IsChan();
	- Added &kick() to Misc.pl; kick command to User.pl.
	- Added &IsNickInChan();
	- Fixed loading Param file before pidfile and other file related
	  stuff.
	- User.pl
		- Revamped; removed unused functions.
		- Moved Set.pl to here.
		- Moved 4op code here.
		- Moved some functions from Process.pl to here.
		- Rewrote rehash command.
	- More casing fixes; debugging info _should_ help to find more.
	- Changed infobot.users.

v0.17.0 (19991126):
	- Netsplit code prevented stats of signoffs; fixed.
	- Messed around with logging code to prevent control chars.
	- Removed exchange and excuse module because of brokeness.
	- Applied patch from RevHippie. Thanks!
		- Added delimiter support in addressing of hello msg.
		- Removed 'score' in karma.
		- Added 'learn' (ALWAYS or ADDRESSED) support. Normal
		  operation == ADDRESSED. Bot won't respond voluntarily to
		  factoids but will respond to learning.
		- Ability to turn off minVolunteerLength.
		- More changes to prevent chatter in unaddressed manner.
	- We remove any ansi or control chars when piping to the log file.
	  RevHippie++.
	- Added 'thanks' language.
	- Typo in Freshmeat.pl; Fixed.
	- Added $rootwarnmode = passive || aggressive to satisfy lilo@OPN.
	  default is passive.
	- Fixed mix up of fix in 'tell' code. I had the if statements the
	  wrong way around.
	- Removed more debug code.
	- FactStats/author fixed; now multiple authors with the same stats
	  are printed together.
	- Added logfile cycling w/ approx maximum size.
	- Changed infobot.config yet again. now it's much better than
	  before. Some variables removed.
	- Added Unset support to Set.pl; Changed so anything can be set
	  or unset.
	- Made use of &purifyNick() so regex doesn't break. $safeWho
	  now defined earlier.

v0.16.0 (19991122):
	- Applied bug fixes from infobot 0.44.3, added md5 password
	  support (*BSD?).
	- Added &IsParam() to check existance of params the proper
	  (strict) way.
	- Moved rootWarn stuff from Extras.pl to RootWarn.pl.
	- filenames (rootwarn and uptime) now not statically set.
	- Cleaned up config file and Setup.pl.
	- Fixed up &parsectcp() in CTCP.pl.
	- Changed ($ischan) to (\S+) in Irc.pl under PRIVMSG.
	- Major reorganisation of Misc.pl -- removed unused functions.
	- Moved some variables to 'infobot'.
	- Fixed ANSI typo by some loser; Changed format of &status()'s in
	  Irc.pl, seems to look nice thus far.
	- Added "author" command under &FactStats() in DBMExtra.pl.
	- Added case insensitivity to &IsHostMatch() and search strings in
	  DBMExtra.pl. Any more of these?
	- Removed disabled netsplit code.
	- Changed 'defined' to 'exists' on all hash lists, 'cept hashes
	  created by opening db's.
	- Modified repeat code on modified_time. If this time is small,
	  msgType is changed to 'private' for flooding reasons and
	  max_time is reduced by half. latter appears not to work???

v0.15.0 (19991112):
	- Quite funny that once the repeat code was moved to Question.pl
	  factoid extension leakage was found. maths leakage was also
	  happening but somehow is fixed when the repeat code was moved
	  back.
	- Clean up of variable names in Reply.pl and Question.pl
	- Changed 'length' to 'eq ""' or 'ne ""' where possible.
	  This should produce faster code but benchmarks prove this change
	  is neglible. Guess perl is slow :)
	- Cleaned up and fixed 'tell <who> about <what>' code.
	- Set.pl fixed; Added DEBUG to allowable set list.
	- Volunteer code moved to top of Question.pl.

v0.14.0 (19991110):
	- Message overflow fix in &FactStats().
	- Added 'factstats new' command to display new factoids in the
	  last 24 hours.
	- Fixed up ping reply, requested by a few from #debian@OPN.
	- Re-added debugging of DBMExtra due to leakage of orthaned
	  factoid extensions. Need to investigate and confirm the
	  lowercase fix of factoids.
	- Two functions which used &mkRandom() now fixed due to poor
	  effort in implementation. Added missing srand(). now the maximum
	  length of 475 should not be exceeded, hopefully. it can be
	  beefed up to 490 if needed.

v0.13.0 (19991108):
	- Made use of &help() which uses infobot.help. This paves the way
	  for NLS as suggested by njs.
	- Fixed up code on netjoin/netsplit in an effort to find
	  statistics leakage. Added debugging info to netjoin/netsplit.
	- Fixed typo (three instances) in factinfo where time() was used
	  instead of the data in the factoid extension. Found by larne.
	- Allow main thread to do a clean exit while the child does
	  nothing. Possible fix for weird uptime info.
	- Removed sar of 'your|i|you|me' to prevent automated reverse
	  persona which is better done by the user. Suggested by njs.
	- Cleaned up behaviour of &FixPlural(). Fixes a bug.
	- Repeat prevention code now replaced (moved aswell) to use
	  factoid extensions
	- Fixed 'factstats requested' error.

v0.12.6 (19991103): bugfix on bugfix release ;)
	- Fixed bug where you can't lock a factoid because the hostmatch
	  ($thisnuh = "") failed. Found by wolfie.
	- Fixed up 512byte overflow in factstats[requested].
	- hm... wonder how I broke Weather.pl.

v0.12.5 (19991101): Bugfix release
	- Fixed "bad" array in Freshmeat.pl. All appologies to scoop.
	  [update: use array[5] if it exists, otherwise do as before.]
	- Removed some debugging info from DBMExtra.pl.
	- Fixed inconsistent chanstats behaviour in SignOff.
	  [Update: forgot to delete the user info _after_ we do the stats]
	- Moved factoid stats count and repeat checking code to
	  Question.pl. Now it works as planned :) :) :)

v0.12.4 (19991028):
	- Added factstat and listauth commands.
	- 'topic add' now prepends subtopic not append.
	- Fixed up minor problem with 'topic restore last'.
	- Changed default of locking access to people who own their
	  factoid or to registered ops. This should please #debian.
	- Reduced usage of @{$var} which cannot be really deleted cleanly.
	- Moved DBMExtra-related stuff from myRoutines.pl to DBMExtra.pl.
	- Added new functions &mkRandom() and &getRandom().
	- Changed all code (Search.pl) which used random to the one
	  developed in DBMExtra.pl. => made code slightly smaller.
	- Cleaned up Search.pl to look nice.
	- Found yet another casing bug under TOPIC in Irc.pl.
	- Fixed bug where dbmextra queries where made on non-factoids like
	  maths and probably karma.

v0.12.3 (19991025):
	- Added while loop around connect which should prevent the bot
	  from falling down (dying).
	- Forgot 'main::' for &getURL in Freshmeat.pl. Changed
	  opening/closing code yet again. Removed checking on open
	  read-only.
	- Changed Dict.pl to reply private only by default. '+' will allow
	  public responses without suggestions/synonyms.
	- Added checking against pidfile. running two bots from the same
	  dir at the same time using the same db == disaster. Ask #debian
	  about it :)
	- Implemented Weather.pl.

v0.12.1 (19991022):
	- Made distribution out of infobot -> blootbot.
	- Irc.pl was prone to be fucking up -- swapped (.*) to (\S+) where
	  necessary. stab lenzo for this :) found more instances of this.
		[update: appears to trap too many of something, check
		  'chaninfo #chan' for info.]
	- Minor fix for Freshmeat.pl when opening/closing db.
	- Factoid extension code is ready for testing. possible in the
	  future to add "factstats" for like: top 3 requested factoids.
	  [update] added lock checking on sar and on updates ("no, "...)

v0.12.0 (19991020): (v0.11.6 + bugfixes + trial)
	- Major shake-up of how addressing is handled -- damn it took me a
	  long time to get this to work.
	- Changed command names in Topic.pl to &topicBlah().
	- Found and fixed (hopefully) all 7 channel casing bugs.
	- Moved freshmeat to use berkeley db instead of raw appindex.txt
	  file. finally got it to work, seems 30% faster. Creating the db
	  takes a long time though.
	- Added "set" command => Set.pl.
	- Added support of talkMethod which behaves much like lobotomy.
	  In the future, talkMethod =~ /(lobotomy|none)/ may be used.
	- Purged: METAR2.pl, NOAA.pl, UAFlight.pl.
	- RootWarn only works if the bot is opped in the channel.
	- Created performStrictReply() from performReply().
	- Quote.pl and Internic.pl now work.
	- Fixed a few typos in myRoutines.pl
	- Removed bold on dictionary.

v0.11.5 (19991012):
	- Fixed $chan to lowercase where appropriate.
	- Fixed volunteer reply code... I guess it worked before but now
	  it is somewhat cleaner and easy to understand.
	- Added factoid owner database, requested by njs.
	- If public message is addressed to someone else, we ignore it.
	- Now support referer factoids ('blah is <REPLY> see erp'). if
	  'blah' is asked, the reply from 'erp' is given.
	- OPN allows part messages -- fixed in /PART/ for $chan.

v0.11.3 (19991008):
	- Uptime.pl appears to be fixed after rewrite of getUptimeInfo.
	- Fixed up Freshmeat.pl for updating the index. Proxy is now
	  optional.
	- Moved rootWarn to RootWarn.pl. Added hall-of-fame of losers.
	- Cleaned up bugs/typo here and there which may have caused the
	  bot to behave in a weird manner.

v0.11.2 (19991006):
	- ChanInfo now displays "statistics" just like our little friend
	  BitchX.
	- Minor change in determining args on commands [myRoutines].
	- Added "cmdstats".
	- Added rootWarn checking on checks. Repeat offenders will be
	  punished. Requested by larne. [update: we aren't so harsh now]
	- Added lc $chan where appropriate. damn uppercase channames.

v0.11.1 (19991005):
	- all instances of undef on hash lists changed to delete which
	  _now_ works. found minor bugs/typos related to DUI.
	- Now skip internic whois intro (13 lines) to fix bad output.
	- Forgot to subtract $i from $counter in chaninfo when full.
		[update: whole function changed, see above]
	- Now backup (and gzip) freshmeat index file.

v0.11 (19991004): looks like a bug fix release :)
	- Fixed typo in reply of Topic.pl/&NewTopic().
	- Decreased max topic length allowed; now print it, too, for
	  debugging.
	- Altered repeat code to only work on public. Flooders should be
	  taken care of by the (allowOutsiders == 0) code. if not, there's
	  'lobotomy' :)
	- Added excess flood protection around &rawout();
	- Don't bother about outsiders if we haven't joined any channels.
	- Changed email address to one throughout modifications.
	  New files have neato headers.
	- Uptime.pl fixed, didn't need to check against ($pid == $$)
	- Repeat-prevention code kind-of looks what it was before but this
	  one, at least, works :). any problems, just bitch at me.
	- Added debugging code for chaninfo to diagnose "problem".

v0.10 (19991001):
	- Added Uptime module.
	- Added Freshmeat module.
	- Dict now returns definition without suggestions (syn's) by
	  default. Also cleaned up.
	- NickServ/ChanServ major clean up.
	- Join upon reconnect fix: set $joinchans = 0.
	- Fixed up Help.pl, added more help entries.

v0.9b (19990925):
	- Did repeat-prevention code from scratch -- now works.
	  [19991001 update]: multiplier is now 2 instead of 10.
	- Made reaction to "hello" more strict. the same should be done to
	  "thanks", don't you think?
	- Converted remaining modules to use forking. should be no more
	  bot lockups...
	- Changed maxhits to 20 for Search.

v0.9 (19990924): +16K added to patch size.
	- More, more and more major changes.
	- Fixed up inappropriate usage of performReply.
	- Added lobotomy command to (un)silence the bot.
	- Added allowOutsiders toggle to prevent usage of the bot
	  _outside_ the channels the bot is in.
	- Added $fullyaddressed, enabled if $addressed == 1 and
	  $param{addressing} == REQUIRE.
	- Readded auto-continuity code. it is disable if not fully
	  addressed. otherwise works as per normal.
	- Moved join-on-start-of-motd code to end-of-motd. If nickserv &&
	  chanserv is enabled, IDENTIFY is done first. If okay, then we
	  proceed to join channels.
	- When bot joins channel, summary of nicks (ops|voice|total) is
	  given instead of NAMES list.
	- Chanserv support moved to "end of names".
	- Detection of nickserv (no such nick).
	- join channel if channel is on our joins list and if we're not on
	  it (hrm, providing their client prevents it).
	- ...

v0.8 (19990919): +50K patch from last version.
	- Major changes, particularly cleanups and fixed a few bugs:
		- Found 2 or so instances of $params{}. Either deleted or
		  renamed to $param where appropriate.
		- Shortened foreach statements where possible.
	- Replaced duplicate code involving &say and &msg with
	  &performReply($text,[0=rand,1=strict]). -- major shortcut and
	  cleanup.
	- Added tracking of all users on channel(s). Users are
	  deleted if they disappear for whatever reason with
	  &DeleteUserInfo.
	- Tracking of channels now works; they are deleted if we disappear
	  from any channel for whatever reason (hopefully).
	- 'forget' command _SHOULD_ be wrapped with $addressed.
	- Moved 'modes' from User.pl to myRoutines.pl as 'chaninfo'.
	- Added stock quote support by using mu's script. Thanks.
	- Added param{*} around stuff in myRoutines.pl for flexibility.
	- Added auto-join on invite if not on specific "join_channels"
	- Renamed &Timetostring to &Time2String and made use of it not
	  only for status but for seen.
	- If $param{*} == false, it is now not defined.
	- Removed Auto-continuity code -- very evil for any bot commands
	  other than non-intentionally requesting a factoid.
	- crypt command required "(" before passwd???
	- Removed stupid commands which just generate URLs for you to cut
	  and paste.
	- repeatIgnoreInterval code _NOW_ works unlike before.
	- Added support for Topic.pl not to update topics if commands are
	  prepended by '-'. Topics can be "rehashed" when either a) the
	  next command is used without '-' or b) "rehash" is the next
	  command.
	- &NewTopic takes two more args to prevent repetition and now does
	  topic checking. Check code for details.

v0.7 (19990914):
	- Major clean up: Search.pl now only uses the "is" dbm; final
	  pair of parens in commands removed for legibility; Removed
	  debugging for NickServ, ChanServ to go.
	- Added multiple subtopic delete ability. requested by Mercury.
	- Moved responses/replies to [files/infobot.lang]. Modified
	  related functions to conform, including mine.
	- Fixed up Kernel.pl to use different type of sockets. Previous
	  code somehow broke itself.
	- Added, but disabled, semi-working timer support. Need to ask
	  lenzo some questions on how to implement it the best way.
	- Added channel (and offender's) notification if someone joins the
	  channel with root. requested by #debian.
	- Added dict.org support. For now, it uses wordnet and returns a
	  random definition. Could change in the future.

v0.6 (19990903):
	- Added support for nickserv and chanserv, requested by is.
	- Updated README to describe new features and modifications. Do we
	  need to elaborate on the modifications to the depth where it
	  would exceed the size of the patch?
	- Minor clean up.
	- Removed assumed-continuity of messages -- should be used if
	  addressing is in optional mode but would be bad in any situation
	  if more than one infobot existed in the channel.
	- Added parsing of g flag to factoid sar.

v0.5 (19990827):
	- Better way to confirm if bot is on channel now for topic
	  management. Also added check for +o+t or -t. &DoModes() on
	  server stuff, too?
	- Patch updated to work for infobot-0.44.2 only.
	- Found a bug in Irc.pl under "NAMES" where $u was used initially
	  but trashed afterwards. => replaced $u w/ $_.
	- Lost track of a bug found by Mercury. Seems to be fixed now,
	  somehow, heh.

v0.4c (19990822):
	- Worked on random-cookie -- random responses can now be added
	  (internally) with ease.
	- Noticed joeyh changing his nick to/from '||' which reminded me
	  of something bad ;) hint: topic management.
	- One line patch to allow '|' in factoids; delimiter is now '||'.

v0.4b (19990818):
	- Implemented patch from mu. Now it is possible to use the topic
	  command through private messages to the bot instead of the
	  channel.
	- Replaced SAR of \| with \|\| so we can still use the single
	  pipes. Double pipes will be either removed or promote an error
	  message. Found by Robot101. Added el-cheapo work-around if the
	  last char of subtopic is |, kill it.

v0.4a (19990816):
	- Added cheap fix (sleep 1, heh) to excess floods of 'topic
	  history'. Is sleep 1 enough?
	- Added 'random' for random value{key} from database.
	  Requested by jCommons.

v0.4 (19990815):
	- Fixed topic history by replacing push with unshift. Now the
	  history list is reversed and cycled properly.
	- Reversed Changes list. request by mu.
	- Totally fixed up topic history since it would break if
	  'topic add' was induced quickly. Now we only record topics set
	  by us (for reasons) and onjoin topics (set by anyone).
	- Removed 'topic last/reset' because how do you know which topic
	  is last? Better control with 'topic restore'.

v0.3c (19990813):
	- Fixed 'topic mv 2 before 1' bug. Forgot to store 'move' topic
	  before doing the foreach loop.
	- Touched up Kernel.pl in preparation for auto-notify feature.

v0.3b (19990812):
	- Added version string to new files so we know which version
	  of patch we're using (or used). There you go, Mercury ;)
	- Fixed up DecipherTopic to reject null subtopics. This would, if
	  unchanged, (theoretically but not tried, luckily) produce a
	  domino-effect of problems if the topic was to be changed.
		Update: check if the supposed null topic contains spaces
			within the nick component. If so, then it's not
			nick, therefore treat like ownerless subtopic.
	- Worked on README.

v0.3a (19990810):
	- Changed back to use topic{chan} (now topicnow{chan}) since
	  @topiclist{chan} (now @topichist{chan}) does not deal with dupes
	  or blanks.
	- Renamed 'topic last' in preference to 'topic reset'. Original
	  command can be used but is vague in meaning.
	- Fixed several typos made in Irc.pl.
	- Replaced 'defined' with 'length' in if statements.

v0.3 (19990809):
	- Applied patch from mu for Irc.pl | Topic.pl.
	- Replaced %topic hash and $topiclast with @{$topiclist{chan}}.
	  Much cleaner implementation. Thanks to mu for this. Fully
	  implemented by xk.
	- Reworked on topicbyme (was topiclast), should work now.

v0.2 (19990808):
	- Changed name of patch to funkystuph.
	- Added history/last/restore to Topic.pl by request of mu and is.
	- Reorganised help and order of commands in Topic.pl
	- Bot must be addressed to use commands.
	  	- Fixed bug if multiple infobots were in the channel.
	- One occurrence where Cipher was called instead of CipherTopic.
	- Fixed up Slashdot.pl. Problems: a) borked completely b) missed
	  first headline. el-cheapo fix but it works.

v0.1c (19990729):
	- Fixed long list{keys|values} bug, hopefully.
	- Now randomize key results from search.
	- If keys contain ',', underline to differentiate it.
	- Fixed possible DoS against Kernel.pl.
	- Bug fixed with Kernel.pl repeating itself.
		- Typo of @results [one occurrance of @result]

v0.1b (19990723):
	- Fixed bug with &CipherTopic where, if no owner was found, it
	  would just use NULL. [like "Topic ()"]
	- Added kernel feature.
	- Moved error messages to public/private, depending on behaviour.
	  Help-related stuff is private(msg) only for convenience.

v0.1a (19990721):
	- Misc cleanup, removed repeated code.

v0.1  (19990720):
	- Initial release.
