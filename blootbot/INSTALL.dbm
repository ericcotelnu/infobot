INSTALLATION of dbm
----------------------

- perl5.004 uses dbm1.85 while perl5.005 uses dbm2.00.  Attempting to
  interchange dbm between the two will result in corruption.
- the dbm will produce two files of the same size (for some reason)
- If the bot crashes, the dbm file may increase in size dramatically, from
  900k-1400k to 16m-24m
- dbm is a slow but simple form of db.  If you want performance, try mysql
  or sqlite (NOT SUPPORTED) or pgsql (NOT YET)

= To convert dbm file to mysql table:
	- run 'scripts/dbm2mysql.pl old-db' to convert dbm database file
	  to mysql.
