blootbot v1.0.0RC3 (20000709)
-------------------------

INTRODUCTION
	This bot is based upon infobot-0.44.2 by kevin lenzo
<lenzo@cs.cmu.edu>. The basis of infobot is still there but _many_ wild
features have been added. Along the way, a couple of typos were spotted
in the original infobot source and fixed in this version. Without infobot,
there would be no blootbot so all thanks to kevin for bringing infobot in
the first place.

	as of 0.99pre1, blootbot supports mysql database in the hope to
increase performance and to avoid borked over dbm's which occurred when
the bot crashed (??). The mysql code is far larger (or perhaps twice
as many functions) than expected even though a few functions were needed
for DBM due to lack of table deficiencies.

	as of 1.0.0pre1, blootbot takes advantage of Net::IRC. The change
over was fairly comfortable (95% clean). Just minor problems here and
there, mostly debugging and getting it right.

UPDATE:
	as of 1.0.0RC2, the old style DBM (Berkeley) has been ported back.
It should work in all but 3 specific (countdown, factstats unreq) cases.
preliminary pgsql support has been added but someone with pgperl knowledge
needs to fix it up or at least unify the module with mysql.

	Please apply the patches from patches/*.patch. Method:
		cd /usr/lib/perl5
		cat *.patch | patch -p0
		### FIXME: what's the best way to apply patches?
		### for the time being, patch manually.

	Be warned that this bot consumes quite a lot of memory upon start
up and during usage. Right now, 7.4megs is used for old'ish perl, 8.3megs
with perl 5.005. fork() is used but don't be alarmed at the memory usage
as fork(), as I was told, uses COW (copy on write).

	WARNING: enabling wingate support may involve complaints of some
sort, probably because the telnet connection isn't closed properly.
However, these people do not realize the potential of open wingates.

	Please beta test it and report bugs as I have not had the time to
test all modifications properly (and extensively).  Suggestions are
welcomed.

	a few guys from #debian@OPN are attempting to rewrite the bot in C
to support dbm185or2//mysql//postgresql. It's available at
ftp://leguin.org.uk/pub/bloatbot/

FEATURES
	* Additional information stored with factoids. (factinfo)
	* Wide range of statistics for Bot, Factoids, IRC, Debian.
	  (status, factstats, ircstats, chanstats, cmdstats)
	* Advanced topic management. (the first cool feature)
	* Improved factoid search, allowing search by key or value.
	* Freshmeat support (freshmeat.net)
	* Debian Contents and Packages, search and info.
	* ChanServ/NickServ (OPN) support.
	* WWW-Search (eg: google for BLAH)
	* Slashdot,Kernel and Freshmeat auto-update announcements.
	* Units conversion (provided by external module, Units-Module)

	DESIGN
		- Modularity. Ability to disable IRC or Factoid support.
		- Funky pseudo Module autoloader support
		- Eleet Forker() function

Improvements include:
	* log file is not opened and closed for each line of data
		=> unblocked logging is used.
	* seen data is not flushed for each public message on IRC
		=> caching and flushing over an interval is used.

MODIFICATIONS
	All modifications are that of the blootbot author unless otherwise
specified, like none.  See 'ChangeLog' for details.  A list of future
features listed in 'TODO'.

	See 'USAGE' for complete list of commands with description
(FIXME) and examples (FIXME).  Yes, it is incomplete.  It is better for
you to find the cookies than for me to hand-feed them to you ;)

	See 'EXAMPLES' for various usage of factoids and "hidden"
variables.  If you're hardcore, check out 'CommandStubs.pl' and 
'UserExtras.pl' for cool features.

### UNTESTED:
	- user statistics shown by 'seen'. bug in this?
	- User Information Services.
	- new wingate caching/file-read code.
	- disabling IRC/factoid support code.
	- PG/DBM supports need to be worked and thoroughly tested.



CONTRIBUTIONS
	jCommons, is, netgod, mu and Mercury for attempting to break my
modifications, aswell as giving suggestions and ideas in the early
development stages. Bashing of modifications courtesy of larne, irq, lilo
and \broken.

	mu@OPN for the SAR (=~ s///) and Topic history patch.

	someone emailed me a patch to fix up telnet but I accidently
deleted the message together with the patch after replying to the guy. I
hope to get that same guy to re-send me the patch...

	MbM sent me a patch to clean up behaviour of factoids
(adding,removing, modifying). Thanks.
